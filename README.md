## Overview of Anlaysis

Using data provided by Citi and their New York City bike share program, we will analyze ridership trends and demographcis for August 2019. We will use Tableau to visiulize our data and also use Pandas to help clean up our dataset.

## Results

#### Mapping Popular Start Locations

Here we can see where the most popular starting locaitons are for riders. As we can see the majority of the largest circles are congregted on the southern tip of Manhattan. This makes sense as this is the central commerical district for New York City.


#### Peak Hours
![Hours](https://github.com/rulma/Bikeshare/blob/77023619df4f6edc4fe7d7bbe92936fbed25f247/Peak%20August%20Hours.PNG)

Displayed here is the peak hours for August displayed on a horizontal bar chart. Each bar indicates and hour on the 24-hour time scale. As you would expect bike rides are at their lowest in the early morning hours and highest during major commuting times.


#### Average Ride Time

Broken down by ride time, we can see that the majority of bike rides last between 5-20 minutes. As ride duration increase the number of rides decreases. It seems that most users use the bikes for fast and short distanced travel around the city.

### Gender Breakdown

Above is the breakdown for gender of riders. Yellow for Males, blue for Females, and red for Unknown. Over 60% of riders are males. Understanding this breakdown will help us understand the next few viziulization.
